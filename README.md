## Description

Not the first time that I'm going to implement it. I even have another github repository with a version more focused on doing it while apply Vue.js as frontend framework, but it's not of my liking because I'd like a backend solutions that might fit better to the tool (not simply for the graduation course).

### General Objectives

0. **Core**

The idea is to have a tool based on a web application that might be able to help the learning of physics through manipulating quantities.<p>
With the time the idea is to increasingly gather more complex features. <p>

Putting in another way:

- Physics quantities manipulations;
- More intuitive physics;
- WEB application.


1. **User**

While using this tool the user must be able to manipulate quantities, by setting it's attributes and so getting a better understanding of how they are related to other variables - how they work.<p>

Furthermore, users should have accounts to make use of the application (by session or persistent) and also have at least the option to set the language to english and portuguese.<p>

The most advanced uses, that I forsee for this application, would be to have natural language embedded in to the features.

Summarizing:

- Quantities attributes manipulations;
- Pratical understanding of physics;
- Multiple languages options;
- Natural language uses (for a distant future).


2. **Implementation**

Here might not have much to be said, beside the obvious. The application must be resilient, easy to maintain, have a good availability and use up to date technological solutions.

In keypoints:

- Available;
- Resilient;
- Maintainable;
- Up to date solutions;
